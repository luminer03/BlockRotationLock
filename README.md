# Block Rotation Lock

## Features

This mod implements Quark's Block Rotation Lock feature as a standalone Fabric mod.

Press the lock key (default: H) to set the lock direction. (Targeted block face or view direction if no block is targeted)

Blocks you place while the lock is active will be placed as if you were looking at that block face or in that direction.
